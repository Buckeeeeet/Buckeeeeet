## Clockwork Adventure:

*A side project video game.*

A platformer with graphics inspired by retro GameBoy games.

Initially made for a one-day gamejam, I have decided to keep this project around in the hopes of continuing it, as a sort of practice.

## Tales from Deeper:

*A side project video game.*

A character-driven dungeon crawler, mix between a Roguelite and a J-RPG.

Currently, only its bases are written, and nothing functional is available.
